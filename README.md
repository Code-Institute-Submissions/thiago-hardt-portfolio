# Thiago Hardt Portfolio

Hello there!

This project aims to create a fully functional static front-end site using technologies learned throughout Code Institute full stack web developer course.

# UX

This is a website for a beginner full-stack software developer.
The main goal of the page is to create a web presence and act as a link between the developer and potential employers and or clients.

One of the most important aspects of the website is to keep the navigation simple and as straight-forward as possible. To achieve that I have opted to use a one-page structure, with the main information being the “hero” image followed by the developer’s name and a quick access button linking to the “about” section and another to a downloadable _CV_. Utilizing this structure I make that the most critical information will be not more than 3 clicks away from the user.

## User Story

- As a **software developer**
- I want to **showcase my work in the web**
- So that **employers and clients can find or hire the user for future projects**

## Features

The page consists of 4 main sections: Home, About, Projects, and Contact.

**Home:**
Contains the main information and it’s where you first land.

**About:**
Quickly brief about the developer’s background and skills, with an option to download CV for further information.

**Projects:**
The main projects the developer worked on. Every project contains a short brief to describe it and two buttons, One for a live view of the project and one for the source code.

**Contact:**
Contact form.

### Existing Features

- **Download CV Button:** This feature enables the user to directly download a .pdf version of the developer’s CV.


### Features Left to Implement

- Possibly a **Blog** feature where the user can showcase interests and IT related content

## Technologies Used

Throughout the project, the following technologies were used.

- [HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5)
  - The project uses **HTML5**
- [CSS3](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Archive/CSS3)
  - The project uses **CSS3** to create styles for the page.
- [Bootstrap 4.5.x](https://getbootstrap.com/)
  - The project uses **Bootstrap 4.5** for quick responsiveness and pre-made components.
- [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/)
  - The project uses **StackEdit** to write the README file.
- [Hover](https://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/)
  - The project uses **Hover** for hover effects.
 - [ScrollReveal](https://scrollrevealjs.org/)
   - The project uses **ScrollReveal** to apply scrolling effects effects.

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1.  Contact form:
    1.  Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2.  Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3.  Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4.  Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## [](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/readme-template#deployment)Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
